# Principles

This repository is a work-in-progress effort to document some of the principles that guide my life and work at this point.

## Big Picture

Principles are half-way between virtues and actions. They are more tangible than general virtues (ανδρεια - courage in the face of uncertainty, σοφια - the wisdom of choosing the right action in a given situation, etc.).  However, they are much more brittle and subject to more change and adjustment as circumstances change.

## Obvious influences

* Ray Dalio. Principles, Life and Work
* Nassim Taleb. Antifragile, Skin in the Game

## Work

### Entrepreneurship

* Focus on the process.
  * The outcome is mostly out of your hands.
  * Strive for excellent execution in each part.
  * Balance speed, cost and fragility.
* Don't get caught up in operations, be prepared for opportunities.
* Be gentle to yourself.

### Strategy, from playing Go

* Competition and your opponent is there to bring forth your best self.
* Always assume your opponent makes her best move and plan for it.
  * Know how to punish/exploit slow moves.
  * If your opponent plays optimally, the best you can get is a balanced
    position.
    * So embrace and expect balance.
* Ask "what's the largest move on the board?".
* Playing it safe is too slow.
  * Be aware of your weaknesses.
  * Be prepared to either shore up your weaknesses or sacrifice.
* Big picture success can only be achieved by skill in the details.
  * But getting lost in details is not getting you anywhere.
* Learn to hold multiple possible future worlds in your head.
  * Get comfortable with uncertainty.
* If you need to make many slow moves only to live, your opponent is getting free moves.

### Business decisions

* Don't focus exclusively on measurable metrics - pay attention to the qualitative details.
* Build simple, heuristic models (financial or otherwise), but don't rely on them too heavily.

### Management & Mentoring

* Make as few decisions yourself as possible, encourage and empower the team to make decisions.
* Don't micromanage, mentor.
* Listen and look out for any sparks of excitement and enthusiasm in your team members.
  * The (long term) cost of denying team members to work on things they are excited about can be prohibitive.
  * Work hard to find alignment between individual and organisational goals and challenges.
  * Provide realistic ways for team members to work on important, non-urgent,  personally meaningful projects consistently.

### Software craftmanship

* Readability is much more important than performance.
* Every engineering trade-off has to be considered within the broader context of the lifetime of the organisation and the experience and size of the team involved.
* Allow technical debt and domain drift deliberatly and sparingly.
